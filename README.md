# Machine Learning Test
- Machine learning test: A Data-Driven Approach using RandomForestRegression

# Introduction  
- In the subsequent sections of this project, we will delve into data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction. By combining analytical insights with machine learning techniques, we aim to create a predictive model that not only encapsulates the dynamics of bike-sharing systems but also provides valuable insights into the factors driving rental demand in urban environments.

# Aim of Project
- This project aims to harness the power of machine learning to predict bike rental demand by leveraging historical usage patterns and incorporating weather data.
- The predictive model developed using the training dataset will subsequently be applied to the test dataset to forecast the count of total rentals for each hour over the next 6 months.
- The overarching goal is to create a robust and accurate model that considers the intricate relationships between various features and the target variable.

# Challenges in Project
- The challenge in this project lies in understanding how different factors, including weather conditions and temporal aspects, influence the demand for bike rentals. 
- The evaluation metric for this endeavor is the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), which emphasizes the importance of accurately predicting both small and large counts while penalizing underestimation.

# Methodology

### Load Dataset:
- Begin by loading the training dataset (train.csv) to understand its structure.
 
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of features and the target variable. Visualizations can be employed to identify patterns and relationships.
  
### Feature Engineering:
- Datetime Processing: Extract relevant information from the 'datetime' column, such as hour, day, and month, to capture temporal patterns.
- Categorical Encoding: If necessary, encode categorical variables like 'season' and 'weather' using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
- Feature Selection: Identify and select the most influential features that contribute to predicting bike rental demand.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling Missing Values: Address any missing values in the dataset, utilizing techniques such as imputation or removal.
- Train-Validation Split: Divide the training dataset into training and validation sets for model training and evaluation.
 
### Model Selection and Training:
- Choose Regression Model: Select a regression model suitable for predicting the 'count' variable. Options include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms.
- Model Training: Train the selected model using the training dataset.

### Evaluation:
- Prediction on Validation Set: Use the trained model to make predictions on the validation set.
- Evaluation Metric: Assess the model's performance using the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) metric, emphasizing accurate prediction across a range of rental counts.

### Model Tuning:
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance
- Feature Engineering Iteration: Iterate on feature engineering based on insights gained during the evaluation phase.

### Predictions on Test Data:
- Apply Model to Test Set: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset (test.csv), which contains data for the next 6 months

# Conclusion
- The project has successfully developed a predictive model for bike rental demand, incorporating both historical usage patterns and weather-related features. The iterative nature of the methodology allowed for continuous improvement, resulting in a model capable of making accurate predictions on unseen data. The insights gained from the project not only contribute to the optimization of bike-sharing systems but also offer valuable knowledge on the factors influencing urban mobility patterns.
